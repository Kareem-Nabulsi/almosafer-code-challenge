# Code Challenge

This repository includes the solution for both:
- **[Challenge 1](https://github.com/Kareem-Nabulsi/almosafer-code-challenge/blob/main/challenge1.py)**
- **[Challenge 2](https://github.com/Kareem-Nabulsi/almosafer-code-challenge/blob/main/challenge2.py)**

## Overview

- The solution for both challenges has been created using **Python**, utilizing a **PostgreSQL** database to store and fetch the data.
- The results for both challenges can be found inside the respective Excel sheets labeled for each code challenge.
- The **QA report** can be found inside the Word file.

## Project Structure

- `challenge1.py`: Solution for Challenge 1.
- `challenge2.py`: Solution for Challenge 2.
- `Challenge One - Results.xlsx`: Excel sheet with results for Challenge 1.
- `Challenge Two - Results.xlsx`: Excel sheet with results for Challenge 2.
- `QA Report.docx`: Word file containing the QA report.

### Notes:
- I have assumed that the results must be trimmed to the second decimal point
- I have found an extra column that is set by business requirements, but is not mentioned in L1 and has no equation to be created from. I have copied the column from L2 and added it to L1, while adding the missing values as zero to avoid any issues.
